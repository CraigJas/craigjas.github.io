			<h1>Gurdwara Etiquette</h1>
			<p>The wedding <a href="../ceremony">ceremony</a> will take place in a Sikh Gurdwara. The Gurdwara is a conservative environment.</p>
			<p>All wedding guests are required to cover their heads before entering the Darbar Sahib (main hall) or Langar Hall (communal kitchen). Men will be given rumals (head covering) to cover their heads. Women will need to use a chunni (head covering) that is part of traditional attire to cover their head. If you are wearing western clothing, we would recommend that you bring a scarf to cover your head.</p>
			<p>Please do not wear clothing that is too revealing. If you are choosing to wear a dress, it should either be floor length or you should wear opaque tights as bear legs are frowned upon. Ladies to wear North Indian Suits is highly recommended.</p>
			<p>Guests are expected to sit on the floor with their legs crossed. Please ensure that you are wearing clothes that you can easily do this in.</p>
			<p>Please do not smoke or drink on Gurdwara premises (even in the car park). Please do not enter the Gurdwara if you have consumed alcohol before the wedding.</p>
			<p>No alcohol will be served during the snack or lunch at the Gurdwara. All of the meals provided at the gurdwara will be vegetarian.</p>
			<p>Parents with babies, as space is tight please do not bring pushchairs for babies. Small carry cots will be fine.</p>
