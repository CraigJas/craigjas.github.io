			<h2>Anand Karaj - Sikh Ceremony</h2>
			<p>Anand Karaj (blissful occasion) is a traditional Sikh ceremony centered around the Sri Guru Granth Sahib, the sacred scripture of the Sikhs.</p>
			<p>The bride and groom sit before the Sri Guru Granth Sahib and consciously commit to stand by each, even in the face of adversity.</p>
			<p>The father of the bride will then place one end of the scarf in the bridegrooms hand, passing it over the shoulder and lacing the other end in the hands of the bride.</p>
			<p>The Guru Granth Sahib is then opened and Lavaan, or marriage hymns, which consists of four stanzas, is read.</p>
			<p>The bride and groom, still each holding their end of the scarf, will walk around the Guru Granth Sahib four times, corresponding with the four verses:</p>
			<p><b>Stanza 1:</b> is about letting go of the past and embarking on a new beginning. It stresses that the center of marriage is spirtual and that the success of the marriage rests on the couple having a daily spiritual practice.</p>
			<p><b>Stanza 2:</b> states that God is at the centre of the marriage and that such a marriage is filled with joy.</p>
			<p><b>Stanza 3:</b> gives the understanding that both love and liberation lie within the company of those who gather together for worship, it is through this that we realise our destiny.</p>
			<p><b>Stanza 4:</b> is the final stage which relates to the fulfillment of the goal in life. It is the stage of union when the couple becomes one soul in two bodies.</p>
